  rule:
    hopperShulkerStacking:
      name: Hopper Shulker Box Stacking
      desc: |-
        Enables hopper transfers to stack empty shulker boxes when 'stackableShulkerBoxes' rule is enabled.
        In the default state this rule prevents shulker box stacking for compatibility reasons.
    overstackedShulkerSignalStrength:
      name: Overstacked Shulker Signal Strength
      desc: |-
        Changes how stacked shulker boxes affect comparator output:
        - 'true': Shulkers have signal strength of unstackable items, allowing comparator signal up to 897 (AKA OSS/HSS).
        - 'false': Shulkers have signal strength of stackable items, reaching 15 when all slots are full (hoppers won't be able to fill over SS1).
        - 'capped': Shulkers have signal strength of unstackable items, but the resulting output is capped at 15. This implementation preserves overstacked item filters.
        - 'normalized': Any amount of shulkers in a slot is counted as a single unstackable item. This limits the output to signal strength 15 and patches overstacked item filters.
    hopperCollectSingleShulkers:
      name: Hoppers Collect Single Shulkers
      desc: |-
        Prevents hoppers from picking up a whole item entity stack at once.
        See also: 'minecartCollectSingleShulkers'.
    minecartCollectSingleShulkers:
      name: Hopper Minecarts Collect Single Shulkers
      desc: |-
        Prevents hopper minecarts from picking up a whole item entity stack at once.
        See also: 'hopperCollectSingleShulkers'.
    overstackedMinecartSlowdown:
      name: Overstacked Minecart Slowdown
      desc: |-
        Changes behaviour of hopper and chest minecarts with stacked shulkers.
        When enabled, minecarts with overstacked items will receive additional slowdown.
        This functionality is affected by 'overstackedShulkerSignalStrength', 
        which when set to 'false' will prevent minecart slowdown as well.
    legacyShulkerItemMerging:
      name: Legacy Shulker Item Merging
      desc: |-
        Enables shulker box item merging logic Carpet used prior to the 1.20.5 update.
        It allows partial item merging (i.e. 48 + 32 -> 64 + 16) and resets merging cooldown on every attempt.
        Some contraptions like shulker box colour sorters relied on this behaviour and are broken without this rule.
    clientShulkerSync:
      name: Sync Stacked Shulker Count
      desc: |-
        Fixes displayed shulker amount on vanilla clients. See issue #1899 in Carpet's repo.
